> Desert features expanded to incentivise exploration and utilisation

**Mirage** expands underutilised features within hotter biomes such as armadillos to make these underappreciated biomes stand out!

### ✨ Features

* **Become friends with the armadillos:** Make a chestplate out of their scutes that you can wear to prevent scaring them!

* **Faded Terracotta:** Terracotta with the patterns of glazed terracotta, great for building ruins!

* **Ruined Structures:** Scattered all across the hot biomes, grab your brush and do some archaelogy, they contain all new sherds alongside resources to help you out in the early game.

* **Bundle Alternatives:** Craft a basket from their scutes so you can organise your inventory without having to kill any animals (Make sure to turn on the bundle experimental feature)

* **Fully Configurable:** Enable or disable any feature within the mod through the config, including enabling the ability to craft any sherd or making faded terracotta rarer by making it uncraftable!

* **More coming soon:** This mod is in very early stages and more vanilla feeling features are on their way!
