> Cinematic, physics-enhanced explosions that feel powerful and dynamic.

**Explosion Overhaul** re-imagines Minecraft's vanilla explosion system with immersive visual and audio feedback â€” perfect for adventure, combat, realism-focused or even tech modpacks.

---

### âœ¨ Features

* **Works with every explosion:** All vanilla and most modded explosives (such as creepers, TNT, crystals and fireballs) are all supported! 

* **Physics Based Debris:**
  Explosions launch nearby blocks into the air as falling block entities with randomized speed, arc, and rotation. Enhances destructive capabilities of explosions.

* **Screen Shake:**
  Players near an explosion experience configurable camera shake based on blast power and distance.

* **Ear-Ringing Effect:**
  An ambient ringing sound plays when standing close to large explosions, enhancing the feeling of impact. Defaults to off, can cause discomfort especially at high volumes.

* **Every Feature is Configurable:**
  Customize behavior via `config/explosion-overhaul.json`, including:

    * Debris count, velocity ranges, and spawn chance
    * Shake strength, radius, and duration
    * Sound toggle
    * Debug logging
