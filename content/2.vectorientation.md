# Vectorientation Reforged

**Available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vectorientation-reforged) and [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vectorientation-reforged)**

A client-side mod to rotate blocks in the direction they are travelling. Additionally, it can apply some squash & stretch to them based on their speed, the amount of which can be disabled, fully configured and even disabled on a per-block basis.

This mod only changes how these blocks render so can operate entirely client-side!

A nice companion to one of Perxenic's other mods: [Explosion Overhaul](./explosion_overhaul)

A complete rewrite of the original [Vectorientation](https://modrinth.com/mod/vectorientation) by [Tec](https://modrinth.com/user/Tec)
